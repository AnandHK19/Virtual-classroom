# 🎓 Virtual Classroom with Real-Time Attention Detection

A web-based virtual classroom that uses real-time webcam feed to detect whether a student is paying attention or not using face and eye detection. This system helps educators monitor student engagement in virtual learning environments.

---

## 📌 Description

This project utilizes OpenCV for computer vision and Flask for backend development. The system detects a student's face and eyes through their webcam and determines their attention status. The detected results are logged with timestamps into a text file for future analysis.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Real-time webcam streaming in browser
- 👁️ Face and eye detection using Haar cascades
- 🧠 AI logic to evaluate attention status (Paying / Not Paying)
- 🕒 Automatic timestamped attention logging
- 💾 Logs stored in `attention_log.txt`
- 🌐 Web-based, lightweight and easy to use
